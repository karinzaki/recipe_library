# Recipe Library

## :helicopter: Overview
A recipe library app where the user is able to access each recipe broken down into calorie count, ingredients and method. Each recipe is categorised and accessible under meals of the day. The user is able to sign-up to the app and once logged in, has the ability to add recipes and edit/delete existing recipes.

## :mag_right: My experience
- Researched other apps ideas to come up with the idea of a recipe library
- Researched other recipe libraries to see layouts, functions and user experience
- Used pseudocode and wireframes to plan the project aims and actions
- Developed a skeleton code that then rooted into the more detailed codes
- Difficulties I ran into:
  > Allowing add/edit/delete functions only when user is logged in
  > Creating a confirmation pop-up function for the delete request
  > Manipulating CSS to better the user experience
